<h3 align="center"> Historical analysis of football teams ⚽ </h3>

  All started when my friends made a bet on the results of the America´s Cup. I wanted to win but I don't know anything about football 😑 so I did a historical analysis of football matches with the aim of observing historical trends and discover insights of the game. The final objective is to create a set of statistical tools to determine the results of the matches.
